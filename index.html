<p>Dr. Yu-Chien Bo Ning is a Research Associate at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health working with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K0JR5-kAAAAJ&hl=en"> Molin Wang</a>. 
Before Harvard, he worked at the LPSM (a department has a rich history with its inception tracing back to Denis Siméon Poisson) of Sorbonne Université in Paris, and in the Department of Statistics at the University of California Davis and Yale University. 
He received his Ph.D. in Statistics from North Carolina State University in 2018.</p>

<p>Dr. Ning is a researcher in statistics and data science, with deep interests in Bayesian machine learning methods and statistical theory.
His work focuses on the development and analysis of Bayesian methods for complex, high-dimensional, and nonparametric data. He has contributed to fundamental problems such as minimax estimation, uncertainty quantification, and large-scale multiple testing, often motivated by real-world challenges.
He collaborates closely with applied scientists in astronomy, economics, sociology, and public health, developing modern Bayesian and ensemble learning tools to address challenging problems in data science. His current research interests include survival analysis, deep learning, ensemble methods, measurement error correction, and multiple testing for high-dimensional categorical data.
